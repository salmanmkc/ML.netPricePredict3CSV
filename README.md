# ML.netPricePredict3CSV
This is project done on the new ML.net framework to do price prediction which was fully released at Microsoft Build 2019 (May)
**ML.netPricePredict3CSV** is a project which I made using ML.net 1.0, to predict the price based off a CSV file, you can input as many parameters as you want, the more the better your result. You can download the CSV file directly from here or just find it in the project files: [taxi-fare-train.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/master/samples/csharp/getting-started/Regression_TaxiFarePrediction/TaxiFarePrediction/Data/taxi-fare-train.csv "training data") so that you can try train your own model! Happy to see how accurate your models get, all data came directly from Microsoft.
